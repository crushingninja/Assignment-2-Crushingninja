A2: U.S. COVID Trends
Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through quantitative means. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the New York Times. While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

You'll load the data directly from the New York Times GitHub page, and you should make sure to read through their documentation to understand the meaning of the datasets.

Note, this is a long assignment, meant to be completed over the two weeks when we'll be learning data wrangling skills. I strongly suggest that you start early, and approach it with patience. We're asking real questions of real data, and there is inherent trickiness involved.

Analysis
You should start this assignment by opening up your analysis.R script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data. Throughout the script, there are prompts labeled Reflection. Please write 1 - 2 sentences for each of these reflections below:

What does each row in the data represent (hint: read the documentation!)?

**Each row represnts a relevant statistic that indicates the # of cases/deaths within the nation, states, and counties. The rows also represent other factors that affect the rise in cases and deaths**

What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated the state with the lowest cases (and what does that tell you about testing your assumptions in a dataset)?

**I learned that my assumptions/educated guess was not the right answer, but using the logic of population in each state, and living conditions, I got close to the answer**

Is the location with the highest number of cases the location with the most deaths? If not, why do you believe that may be the case?

**No, beacuse there are many other factors that can disrupt the correlation between cases and deaths, most notably being elderly population. Which means one state can have the highest # of cases, but not many will die as the state with a less # of cases, but more elderly people or people with breathing problems**

What do the plots of cases and deaths tell us about the pandemic happening in "waves"? How (and why, do you think) these plots look so different?
The reason these cases and deaths are happening in waves, is because when cases start to go down, people start to get more careless, and go out more often to attend events with lot of people. This carelssness causes the cases to rise, because a small percent of that huge crowd had covid and easily spread it amongst the rest of the people there

Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable lowest_in_each_state (i.e., wouldn't you expect the number to be ~50)?

**I'm not sure how to answer this**

What surprised you the most throughout your analysis?

**Nothing really stood out to me**
